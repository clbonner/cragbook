Installation Notes
==================

Installing Cragbook is very simple. 

1. Copy the files in to the folder on your web server where you would like to host it. 

2. Import the 'cragbook.sql' file in to the MySQL database that you would like to use.

3. Make sure that all PHP file permissions are set 644 and folders to 755.

4. Change the settings in include/config-example.php for your installation, then rename it to config.php.

And away you go!

The default username and password are 'admin' and 'password'. These can be changed in Preferences.

Enjoy!
