        <p>Using Cragbook is very simple. You can look for information in one of three ways using the site menu above.</p>
        
        <div>
            <p><span class="btn btn-border">Areas</span> Shows you a list of areas, wherein lies all the crags for that area.</p>
            <p><span class="btn btn-border">Crags</span> Shows you all crags regardless of areas.</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-search btn btn-border"></i> Allows you to find routes by using one or more search criteria.</p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <p>When viewing areas or crags, each page has some buttons that do the following. </p>
        
        <div id="viewpicker">
            <p><i class="fa fa-list btn btn-border"></i> Displays a list of areas/crags.</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-info btn btn-border"></i> Shows crag information on crag pages.</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-map-o btn btn-border"></i> Shows a map of areas/crags.</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-print btn btn-border"></i> Prints a list of currently selected routes and area/crag information.</p>
        </div>

            In the routes section you can use the filter to specify which climbing disciplines and grades you want to see. Columns can also be used to sort the routes.
            
            <div id="gradefilter"></div><script>$("#gradefilter").html(gradeFilter("crag"))</script>
        </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>
            As per our guidebooks, against each route you will see a coloured dot indicating the type of climb.</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-circle-thin"></i> Trad Climb</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-circle yellow"></i> Sport Climb</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-circle yellow"></i> <span class="hybrid">Hybrid Climb (bolts/pegs/nuts)</span></p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-circle"></i> Bouldering</p>
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p>
            Additionally, on sport climbs you will see a coloured smiley indicating the friendliness of the bolting and how bold it may feel.</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-smile-o green"></i> A good choice. Friendly bolting for the grade. Just go climbing and no worries about the clips.</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-meh-o amber"></i> Adequate. Some worrisome run-outs, some disconcerting clips, but generally OK.</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-frown-o red"></i> Care required. A degree of danger present; some gripping clips, some scary run-outs, maybe a dodgy bolt or perhaps all of them!</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i> Danger not within your control. Usually means multiple untrustworthy or bad bolts and/or poor anchor.</p>
